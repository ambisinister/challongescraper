# Challonge Scraper

```
python scrape.py
```

TODO:

- Currently this doesn't return all of the results, but only a subset? The way challonge updates the page is very confusing, need to talk to someone who is better at actually understanding this sort of thing.
- Need to write a function which outputs this into readable formats etc of course.
